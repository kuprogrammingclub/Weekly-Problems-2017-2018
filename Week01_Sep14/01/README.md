Given an array of integers and a target integer `sum`, return `true` if there exists a pair of integers in the array which add up to `sum`, and `false` otherwise.

See if you can come up with an O(n^2) solution first. Thenâ€”can you come up with an O(n log n) one?

`Sample input`

`array = [-1, -2, 5, 0], target = -1`

`array = [-1, -2, 5, 0], target = 6`
