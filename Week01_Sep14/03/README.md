Consider a string containing only `(` and `)` characters. We say this string is balanced if and only if, for every opening parenthesis, there is a matching closing parenthesis (to the right of it).

Here are some examples of balanced strings:

`(())`, `()()`, `((()())())`, `()`

Here are some examples of strings that are not balanced:

`)(`, `(()(`, `)))))`, `()(()(())()()))`

So, given a string formatted in the above way, write a method that returns `true` if it is balanced, and `false` if it is not.
