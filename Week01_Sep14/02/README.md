Write a method that, given an array of integers, returns the only uncoupled integer in the array. That is, return the value that only appears once.

It is guaranteed that the array will be non-empty, and will have only one value that appears exactly once. All other values will appear exactly twice.

``Sample input 1``

`[10, 20, 25, 10, 25]`

``Output``

`20`


``Sample input 2``

`[1, -5, 1, 2, 4, 3, 7, -5, 7, 3, 8, 8, 2]`

``Output``

`4`
