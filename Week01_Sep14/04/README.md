This is Pascal's Triangle: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_triangle

Write both iterative and recursive methods to find the number in the `i`th row and the `j`th column of the Triangle.

If the `i`th row and `j`th column does not exists, or if the number is too big to store in a 32-bit int, throw an exception.
