# KU Programming Club <br> 2017-2018

### Preface
If you have any trouble getting started with Github, or have other questions Shaina
and I (Blaine) will be in the Slack channels.  Either direct message or get ahold
of us through the #Programming-Club channel.  If there's enough interest we might
do a quick review of Github during the next meeting for those that need some hands
on practice.

- KUPC Co-Chairs Blaine, Shaina
