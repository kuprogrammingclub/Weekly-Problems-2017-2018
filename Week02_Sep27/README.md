Hey folks,

I wanted to try a different approach to the weekly problems this week.
Instead of having a few (4-5) standalone problems like previous weeks and years have done,
I have combined them all into one giant problem with multiple parts.
This way they all share a common theme, and can build on each other.
This week's problems are about strings, finding substrings, and manipulating strings in certain ways.

Let me know if you have any feedback on this style!
